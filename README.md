## Why this ?

This model was created because of one [John Nixon](https://github.com/JohnNixon6972) who wanted to use multiple emojis in sequence, to easily convey with others. So, thus incepted the idea of making gifs out of the emojis typed out.

## How this ?

The tech stuff used are as follows:

1. [JoyPixels](https://www.joypixels.com/) to convert the emoji to images, and it also lets you convert `:smile:` to ðŸ˜„.
2. [GifShot](https://github.com/yahoo/gifshot) to convert the images into a gif.
3. [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) to remove the white background of all the emoji images with the following command. 
```
cd assets
for i in *.png; do convert -flatten $i $i; done
```
